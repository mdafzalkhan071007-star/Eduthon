            <h2>The Importance of Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Mental health is a fundamental aspect of our overall well-being, just as important as physical health. It
                affects how we think, feel, and act, influencing our ability to handle stress, relate to others, and
                make choices. Good mental health enables us to realize our potential, cope with life's challenges, and
                contribute meaningfully to our communities.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, mental health issues are increasingly common, especially among young people. According to
                the World Health Organization, one in four people will experience mental health issues at some point in
                their lives. For students, the pressures of academic performance, social expectations, and future
                uncertainties can significantly impact mental well-being.</p>

            <h2>Why This Website Was Created</h2>
            <p>Our AI Mental Health Support platform was born from a deep understanding of the unique challenges faced
                by students in today's academic environment. We recognized that traditional mental health support often
                comes with barriers - stigma, cost, limited availability, and long waiting times.</p>
            <p>By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, we've created a platform that provides:</p>
            <ul style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);">
                <li><strong>24/7 Accessibility:</strong> Support whenever you need it, day or night</li>
                <li><strong>Confidential Environment:</strong> A safe space to express yourself without judgment</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Support:</strong> AI that adapts to your unique needs and circumstances</li>
                <li><strong>Student-Focused Resources:</strong> Content specifically designed for academic life
                    challenges</li>
                <li><strong>No Cost Barriers:</strong> Free access to mental health support</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to democratize mental health support by making it accessible, affordable, and stigma-free.
                We believe that every student deserves compassionate care, regardless of their background, location, or
                circumstances. Through the combination of human empathy and artificial intelligence, we aim to create a
                supportive environment where students can thrive both academically and personally.</p>
            <p>We're committed to breaking down the barriers that prevent students from seeking help. Our platform
                serves as a bridge between the need for mental health support and the reality of limited resources,
                ensuring that no student feels alone in their journey.</p>
